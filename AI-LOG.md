# AI log

Tool used: Codex, for planning and initial project setup.

## 1. Local PostgreSQL port

- **Task:** Start the local PostgreSQL service.
- **Problem:** Docker could not bind host port 5432 during setup.
- **Changed:** The assistant changed the host port to 5433, updated the connection instructions, and confirmed PostgreSQL accepted connections. `AGENTS.md` records the port so the team uses the working setup.
- **Evidence:** `compose.yaml` and `README.md`; the first repository commit preceded this change.

## 2. Example environment file

- **Task:** Prepare local configuration while following the PA2 rubric.
- **Problem:** `.env.example` contained values, while the rubric requires variable names without values.
- **Changed:** The assistant copied the local settings to ignored `.env` and cleared the values from `.env.example`. `AGENTS.md` now states this convention.
- **Evidence:** `.env.example` and `.gitignore`; see the current change history for the setup update.

## 3. Framework choice

- **Task:** Discuss a frontend and backend stack.
- **Rejected:** The user rejected the assistant's recommendation to use Next.js for the backend, preferring a backend-focused design.
- **Changed:** The plan uses React with TypeScript and a separate Go backend.
- **Evidence:** `docs/PA2-PLAN.md`, step 1; repository setup commit `aa16e18`.

## 4. Submission setup

- **Task:** Implement login, enrollment, and the submission endpoint with a simple PostgreSQL queue.
- **Changed:** Codex added SCS-backed sessions, versioned migrations, and an atomic submission/job insert. PostgreSQL contract checks run in an isolated temporary schema.
- **Changed:** PostgreSQL `text` cannot store a NUL byte, although the contract allows it in a source string. A second migration stores source as bytes; a contract check verifies preservation.
- **Remaining:** Complete the team's contract review, cover the remaining contract scenarios, and run the checks in required CI.
